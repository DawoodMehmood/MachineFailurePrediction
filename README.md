# MachineFailurePrediction
Repository of Machine learning's semester project - Machine failure and failure type prediction using neural network.
This Repository is dedicated for my Machine Learning's semester project which is a machine failure prediction model made using neural networks. It also caters the prediction of failure type. I have realized the model by first converting it into .h5 and then using a frontend made using Flask. It takes in certain inputs and predicts machine failure and type of the failure. The machine here refers to the machines in manufacturing industry.
